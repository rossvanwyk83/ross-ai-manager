      content: "# Competitor Analysis — ShieldMyShop\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-18*\n\n## Market Landscape\n\nThe Etsy trademark/compliance scanning space is emerging but already has 4-5 players. The market is validated — sellers clearly need this — but no single tool dominates yet. This is a land-grab moment.\n\n## Direct Competitors\n\n### 1. ShopShield (shop-shield.com)\n**Status:** Pre-launch (\"Launching Soon\" — collecting waitlist)\n**Positioning:** \"Stop Takedowns Before They Happen\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n- AI Vision scanning (scans images for trademark violations)\n- Large trademark DB (875+ terms across 22 brand categories)\n- Live demo on homepage (paste a listing to scan instantly)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Not launched yet (Shop integration, monitoring all \"Coming Soon\")\n- No real pricing yet (only free tier is live)\n\n**Threat Level: HIGH** — Very similar product, polished marketing, but hasn't shipped yet. Race to market.\n\n### 2. Capytini (capytini.com)\n**Status:** Live, actively marketing\n**Positioning:** \"Your Shield Against Etsy Suspensions\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Free scan as lead magnet\n- Aggressive funnel (free scan → email capture → upsell)\n- Claims \"Trusted by 45,000+ sellers\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Feels scammy/aggressive (fake urgency timers)\n- More marketing than substance (one-time scan → PDF report)\n- No OAuth integration\n\n**Threat Level: MEDIUM** — Gets traffic but thin product.\n\n## ShieldMyShop's Key Differentiators\n\n1. **Only tool with real Etsy OAuth integration** - Auto-scan actual listings\n2. **Pre-publish checker** - Check before you publish\n3. **Granular risk scoring (0-100)** - Numerical scores with breakdown\n4. **Actually shipped and working** - First-mover advantage\n\n## Strategic Recommendations\n\n1. **Launch ASAP** - ShopShield is pre-launch, every day matters\n2. **Expand trademark DB to 1,000+** and market the number\n3. **Add homepage demo scanner** - highest-converting feature\n4. **Position against Capytini's scamminess** - be trustworthy alternative",

You just took the smartest step most Etsy sellers never take — checking before Etsy checks for you.\n\n**Here's what happens next:**\nYou have 3 free scans ready to go. Connect your Etsy shop (read-only access — we never touch your listings) and we'll scan everything for trademark risks.\n\n→ **[Scan My Shop Now](https://shieldmyshop.com/dashboard)**\n\n**While you're here, a quick stat:**\n87% of suspended Etsy shops never reopen. The sellers who survive are the ones who found their violations before Etsy did.\n\nThat's what ShieldMyShop does. We check your titles, tags, and descriptions against 500+ trademarked brands and Etsy policy rules. You get a risk score (0-100) for every listing, plus exact fix suggestions.\n\nTalk soon,\nRoss\n\nP.S. — Not sure where to start? Try scanning your top-selling listings first. Those are the ones you can't afford to lose.\n\n## Email 2: The Fear Email\n**Send:** Day 3\n**Subject:** This is the email suspended sellers wish they'd gotten\n\n---\n\n{{first_name}},\n\nI want to share something that happens every single day on Etsy.\n\nA seller — maybe someone with 500+ five-star reviews, maybe someone who's been selling for 5 years — wakes up to this:\n\n> *\"Your shop has been suspended due to a violation of Etsy's intellectual property policy.\"*\n\nNo warning. No second chance. Their listings are gone. Their funds are frozen. Their customers see a blank page.\n\n**The worst part?** Most of them had no idea they were violating anything.\n\nCommon triggers that surprise sellers:\n- Using \"Onesie\" in a listing (trademarked by Gerber)\n- Saying \"inspired by [brand]\" (this actually proves you know about the trademark)\n- Character names they thought were generic (Grogu, Bluey, Wednesday)\n- Sports phrases like \"Super Bowl\" (trademarked by the NFL)\n\n**Have you used your free scans yet?**\n\n→ **[Check My Listings Now](https://shieldmyshop.com/dashboard)**\n\nEvery day without scanning is another day at risk.\n\nRoss\n\n## Email 5: The Upgrade Email\n**Send:** Day 10\n**Subject:** Your 3 free scans vs. continuous protection\n\n---\n\n{{first_name}},\n\nIf you've used your free scans, you've seen what ShieldMyShop can do. You know your risk score. You've (hopefully) fixed the issues we found.\n\n**But here's the thing:** trademarks change. Brands file new ones every week. Etsy updates policies without announcement. And if you add new listings, they need to be checked too.\n\n**Your free scans gave you a snapshot. A paid plan gives you a shield.**\n\nHere's what you get with Starter ($12/month):\n- ✅ Weekly automated scans (your shop is always checked)\n- ✅ Full trademark database (500+ brands, updated regularly)\n- ✅ Up to 250 listings monitored\n- ✅ Email alerts when new risks are found\n- ✅ Scan history so you can track improvements\n\n**🔥 Launch Special: Lifetime Access for $149**\nPay once. Pro features forever. No subscription. This offer won't last.\n\n→ **[Get Lifetime Access](https://shieldmyshop.com/#pricing)**\n\nThanks for being an early user. Every scan you run makes your shop safer.\n\nRoss",
